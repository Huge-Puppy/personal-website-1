# Jared Lambert Personal Website
## AKA HugePuppy

Making this open source because I like it like that. Hopefully this site inspires you to start building.

This site is made with:
* 11ty static site generator
* *insert template language here* 
* CSS

and is hosted on Netlify.

I wanted to keep things simple and stick to the basics. Most of my front-end development experience has been in flutter, and I want\
to start from the basics while I go more in depth into front-end web technologies. I'll spin up some other websites later that use\
more advanced technologies... but you'll see everything I'm prepping on the site! 

Enjoy!
