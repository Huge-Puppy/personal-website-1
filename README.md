# Jared Lambert Personal Website
## AKA HugePuppy

first attempt at a website outside university.
works 2/10
looks 3/10
interesting 7/10

This site is made with:
* 11ty static site generator
* nunjucks?
* CSS

* * * 

I wanted to keep things simple and stick to the basics. Most of my front-end development experience has been in flutter, and I want\
to start from the basics while I go more in depth into front-end web technologies. I'll spin up some other websites later that use\
more advanced technologies... but you'll see everything I'm prepping on the site! 

Enjoy!
